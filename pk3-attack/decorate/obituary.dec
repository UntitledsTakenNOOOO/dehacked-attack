/*
A FORWARD ON OBITUARY'S INCLUSION & EXCLUSION

Obiturary, not well-known, is a 1995 doom wad that is likely the first implementation of custom monsters in DEHACKED.

The three monsters featured in it were originally implemented in the confines of DEHACKED.
However, they were later re-implemented in the ZDoom Monster Resource Wad (and later Realm667).

Due to a combination of obscurity and the fact that the most famous versions of these monsters are DECORATE
(and not DEHACKED) I am not considering them part of the mainline DEHACKED Attack.

That being said, in respect for the legacy of this wad, I am including them in the mod,
however, they will be turned off by default, though the option to turn them on exists.
