A a pair of doom randomizers centered around recreating DEHACKED monsters and weapons. No, I don't know why either.

You can use the options in the menu to control which WADs' actor sets are enabled or disabled.

CURRENTLY INCLUDED MONSTERS:

STRAIN (Alpha Dog Alliance, 1997):
* Subverted Guard: A simple re-skin of the chaingunner.
* Class 2 Imp: Moving much faster than normal imps, these guys also fire on repeat.
* Holobot: A flying drone that fires slow moving revenant missiles. Spawns with cacodemons.
* Invisible Holobot: A spectral variant of the previous monsters. Spawns with pain elementals.
* Doppleganger: A variant of the lost soul, these guys will use an imp's attack before charging.
* Skinless Demon: These guys are colored red and are more durable than normal demons, with the odd amount of exactly 217 health.
* Minister of Hate: A miniture cyberdemon with 300 health, firing singular rockets. Spawns in the revenant slot on rare occasions, and has +NORADIUSDMG.
	* Change: It takes longer to wind-up its attack than in STRAIN, because rockets are very deadly, making these things horrific reaction-time checks.
* Demon Lord: A white hell noble with 1400 health that fires baron balls in mancubus-like spreads. Spawns with barons, and is potentially very deadly.
	* Change: The attack animation is broken in the original STRAIN, causing it to fire faster than intended. This has been corrected.

SCYTHE II (Erik Alm, 2005):
* Evil Marine: He's an absolute terror to be up against due to his plasma rifle and high movement speed. Spawns in the archvile slot.
	* Change: Drops a Cell instead of a Clip, because DEHACKED doesn't let you change drops but DECORATE does and the inconsistency bothered me.

SCIMITAR (Cycloid, 2006):
* SSG Trooper: A zombieman wielding a super shotgun with 40 hit points, spawning with zombieman very rarely.
	* Change: Reduced HP from 90 down to 45. It also repeat-fired, and it doesn't do that either. It drops a Super Shotgun for consistency reasons.
* Calfdemon: A white baby cacodemon with 100 hit points, spawning with the lost soul.
* Cacodemoness: A green cacodemon variant emitting green fireballs.
* Mancubus II: A mancubus with a slightly different attack pattern.
* Arachnorocketeer: An arachnotron with red eyes that fires rockets, though it does not fire them on repeat.
* Red baron: A baron of Hell that throws faster and more deadly red fireballs.
	* Change: Red fireballs are much brighter for visibility reasons; you should always be able to see these guys.

DEUS VULT II (Huy Pham, 2008):
* Hell Cleric: Fires imp fireballs rapidly. Spawns commonly with revenants.
	* Change: Has 300 health instead of 200, due to being in a slot with 300 base health.

NEW DOOM COMMUNITY PROJECT 2 (Newdoom Community Team, 2009)
* Slomnibus: Suicide Cacodemon. Fast moving monster that flies above the ground. Once one of these guys bites down on you, they'll explode.
* Possessed Clone Marine: These former marines won't charge at you; instead they will crouch for cover and fire without mercy with their powerful machineguns.
	* Only appears as an Icon of Sin (or other spawn shooter) summon and does not spawn naturally.

SCYTHE X (Erik Alm, 2009):
* Spirit Imp: These mysterious monsters shoot fireballs that summon strange spiritual creatures. Spawns with imps uncommonly, but imps are VERY common.
* Spirit Elemental: A variant of the Pain Elemental; this variant shoots out spirits-summing projectiles fast, and release more spirits when they die.
* Shadow Spirit: The aforementioned spiritual creatures summoned by the Shadow Imp. They do not spawn naturally.

JENESIS (Jimmy, 2011):
* Mutant Gateway Technician: Possessing a whole 90 HP, these are rather durable variants of the shotgunner. Spawns with chaingunners.
	* Change: Drops a shotgun (it drops only a clip in the original Jenesis) to maintain consistency with its weapon of choice.

LUNATIC (skillsaw, 2011):
* Plasma Zombie: A Zombie that can fire arachnotron plasma in bursts of three. Spawns with shotgunners.
	* Change: Drops a cell rather than clip for consistency reasons.
* Revenant Missile Zombie: A 75 HP Zombie that fires revenant missiles. Spawns with chaingunners.
	* Change: Drops a single rocket, because why not.

SURVIVE IN HELL (JC Dorne, 2012):
* Belphegor: A tougher variant of the baron that fires in sets of two fireballs.
* Poison Soul: A small, yet very tanky flying enemy that fires baron fireballs. Spawns in the pain elemental slot.
* Cybruiser (Double-Fire Variant): This variant of the cybruiser has 1300 health, and attacks by firing rockets very quickly in sets of two.
	* The Double-Fire Cybruiser can only be summoned by the Icon of Sin (or other final bosses) and does not spawn naturally.

RESURGENCE (Joshy, 2014):
* Evil Marine (Slow Variant): A variant of the evil marine that moves at less than 20% of the speed. Spawns very rarely with revenants, and is still very deadly.

MAYAN MISHAP (Tango, 2014):
* Greater Mancubus: A variant of the mancubus that can fly and has a slightly deadlier attack pattern.
* Cyber Baron: A cybernetic baron that occasionally fires rockets from its one cybernetic arm.

NOVA II (Various mappers, DEHACKED by Obsidian, 2015):
* Hierophant Clone: A flying baron-like creature with 750 HP that fires triple revenant missiles. Spawns with Archviles.

VALIANT (skillsaw, 2015):
* Valiant Imp: This variant on the imp shoots faster fireballs in sets of two.
* Valiant Demon: These guys bite MUCH faster than ordinary pinky demons.
* Valiant Spectre: Guess.
* Suicide Bomber: These screaming zombies have but one passion in life, and that is exploding, with the intent of being next to their target. Spawns with pinkies.
* Arachnorb: Floating brain-like creatures that fire red plasma bolts at you. Spawns with Lost Souls, and are a bit skinnier than they were in Valiant.
	* Change: Arachnorbs spawned in the lost soul position have smaller radii (24 -> 16) so they fit. Other arachnorbs are still full size.
* Pyro Knight: These guys can unless powerful volleys of fireballs; be careful! Thankfully they only have 500 HP. They spawn with Hell Knights.
* Cybruiser: Although they only possess 500 HP, these guys can shoot rockets, and are even immune to splash damage! They spawn with Hell Knights.
	* Change: They no longer have a wake-up sound that is audible over the entire map.
* Super Mancubus: Unleashing a mancubus' entire set of six fireballs in a single volley, these guys are tough, especially with their 1000 HP. Spawns with mancubi.
* Valiant Arachnotron: Identical to the normal Arachnotron except for color scheme until you kill it, where it has a 2/3 chance to spawn an arachnorb.
	* Change: In the original valiant, it was 1/2 instead of 2/3. The chance was increased because they're rarer outside of valiant.

ANCIENT ALIENS (skillaw et al, 2016):
* Stealth Plasma Alien: A 30 HP alien (actually a zombie) with an alien plasma rifle that is nearly invisible until it becomes active. Spawns with shotgunners.
	* Change: Drops a cell for consistency reasons.
* Alien Guardian: A flying construct that fires salvos of revenant missiles, and even self destructs upon death. Spawns with cacodemons.
	* Change: HP raised from 100 to 200.
* Alien Mancubus: A re-skin of the mancubus with a unique look.
* Alien Arachnotron: A re-skin of the arachnotron that fires the purple-ish alien plasma used by the stealth plasma alien.

* Skull Turret: A stationary turret that fires arachnotron plasma. Only appears as an Icon of Sin (or other final boss) summon.

180 MINUTES POUR VIVRE (French Doom Community, 2018)
* Nightwatch Cacodemon: A very deadly 4-eyed monstronsity with 600 HP that thankfully spawns with pain elementals.

PSX DOOM:
* Nightmare Spectre: A faster moving and much tougher variant of the spectre. Has 300 HP and spawns with spectres, naturally.
	* Note: This is not a DEHACKED original, but I felt like giving tribute to a rather different version of Doom and its one original monster.

DOOM 64 FOR DOOM 2 (Mechadon et al, 2018):
* Nightmare Imp: A spectral (or subtractively rendered, check the options menu for the settings) imp with a cacodemon's fireball attack.
* Nightmare Cacodemon: A spectral (or subtractively rendered) cacodemon with a triple fireball.

AVACTOR: END OF THE FIFTH CIRCLE (Eradrop, 2018):
* Horned Demon: A variant of the pinky demon with 200 HP and a lesser pain chance.
* Plasma Tank: A knight-like figure on top of treads that fires alternating fireballs like an arachnotron, and spawns with said arachnotrons.

* Damned Soul: A 50 HP gray lost soul that explodes when killed and self-destructs to attack.

* Death Incarnate: A re-skin of the revenant, to help visual variety in the slot.
* Lord of Heresy: A 1250 HP Hell Noble that can fire a three-way baron ball spread. Spawns with barons.
	* Change: The latter four monsters are re-based from Realm667, so there may be minor differences in frames and sounds.

STRUGGLE: ANTARESIAN LEGACY (antares, 2018):
* Antaresia: A serpent-like creature that has a strange firing pattern. Spawns with Hell Knights.
	* Change: Uses the Antaresian Reliquary variant instead of the original, for variety's sake (I liked the red better).
* Antaresia Elite: A more powerful variant of the Antaresia that spawns with the Archvile. Has more HP, a lower pain chance, and moves much faster.
* Spectral Cacodemon: A partially invisible cacodemon. It's faster and less susceptible to pain, but only has 240 HP.
* Afriest: A flying priest with a powerful triple attack. Spawns with Cacodemons.
* Antaresian Arachnotron: A variant of the arachnotron that moves faster and uses a chaingun instead of a plasma rifle.

* Alpha Soul: A lost soul variation that shoots cacodemon fireballs instead of charging.

ANTARESIAN RELIQUARY (antares, 2020):
* Former Ranger: Possessing an energy blaster instead of a rifle, these guys are a bit scarier than the ordinary zombie that they spawn with.
	* Change: Drops a cell for consistency reasons.
* Plasma Elite: A variant of the former captain up above; these guys shoot blue energy bolts in volleys of three instead, and spawn with the chaingunner.
	* Change: Uses a blue color scheme more remniscent of Struggle, to make it visually distinct from the Former Captain.
* Reliquary Arachnotron: A variant of the arachnotron that uses the energy bolts used by the former ranger and plasma elite.

DOOM -1 (Community Project, 2020):
* Imp: A functionally identical imp variant with a visually distinct fireball.
* Dark Imp: A stronger, translucent, 100 HP variant of the previous imp.
* Zombie Soldier: A gunman that spawns with chaingunners. Fires slower, but has 80 HP.
* Wicked: A lost soul that has only 20 HP, and self-destructs when in melee range or when killed. Have fun!
* Hell Dragon: A 500 HP flying dragon monster that spawns with Pain Elementals, and fires slews of baron balls.

* Rowdy Shotgunner: Same deal as the previous two. Has 60 HP.
* Rowdy Chaingunner: An 80-HP version of the chaingunner that moves slightly slower.
* Rowdy Plasma Guy: Has 60 HP and a plasma rifle, but it's less damaging than the other plasma zombies. Spawns with zombiemen rarely.
	* Change: Drops a cell for consistency reasons.
* Flamethrower Guy: With 80 HP, this guy is a menace in close quarters. Spawns with shotgunners.
	* Change: Drops a single rocket, in reference to Ray Mohawk's rocket launcher being a flamethrower.
* Rocketman: A stronger Revenant Missile Zombie that spawns with chaingunners. Has 120 HP.
	* Change: Drops a single rocket.
* Psycho Imp: With 150 HP and a stronger attack, be careful around these very strong imp variants. Rarely spawns.
* Blood Demon: A 180 HP variant of the demon.
* Toxicacodemon: A toxic cacodemon that fires green baron fireballs. Still only has 400 HP.
* Flame Cacodemon: A bright cacodemon variant with a MUCH stronger attack and 600 HP that spawns with Pain Elementals.

RAY MOHAWK 2 (Doomkid, 2021):
* Hula Imp: An imp with a more tropical outfit. Statistically identical to the normal imp.
* Sunglasses Zombie: A weaker and less deadly chaingunner that spawns with the rest but only drops a clip.
* Slyor: An addition to the revenant spot, this monster shoots a volley of flames and fireballs that you should be wary of.

JAMAL JONES (Doomkid, 2022):
* Imp: Another nearly functionally identical but visually distinct imp variant.
* Hazmat Zombie: A gunman, similar to the sunglasses zombie up above. Spawns with shotgunners for balance reasons.
* Plasma Zombie: A 90-HP zombie with a plasma rifle. Spawns with chaingunners.
	* Change: Drops a cell for consistency reasons.
* Blind Demon: Despite its supposed 'blindness', this monster can still see, and in fact, moves faster than the normal pinky demon.
* Alien Imp: A green imp that attacks with imp fireballs and baron fireballs, making it much deadlier.
* The Toxicacodemon and Flame Cacodemon are shared with Rowdy Rudy 2 - these will appear if either monster set is enabled.

BOSSES:
* Afrit (Scythe II, Deus Vult II, Survive in Hell, Resurgence): Its volley of fireballs is deadly; you're toast if you get too close. It has 2500 HP and can fly.
	* Spawns with cyberdemons under special circumstances, otherwise it is limited to being summoned by the Icon of Sin and other final bosses.
* Haymaker (UAC Ultra, 2012): A minotaur-like creature that also has 2500 health that has a cyberdemon's head. It shoots mancubus fireballs from its hammer.
	* Spawns with cyberdemons under special circumstances, otherwise it is limited to being summoned by the Icon of Sin and other final bosses.
* Leviathan (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy, 2018): A fast-moving monster who attacks with an entire mancubus volley simutaneously. Spawns with cyberdemons.
	* Change: Reduced health from 10000 down to 4200.
* Remnant Cardinal (Remnant, 2019): A darker, red flying variant of the cyberdemon that fires rockets much faster in salvos of four.
	* Change: It fires more slowly than in Remnant (4 tics/frame state --> 6), and only has 4500 health.
* Blue Cyberdemon (Ray Mohawk 2, 2021): A blue variant of the cyberdemon that fires rockets in rounds of six.
* Heresiarch (180 Minutes Pour Vivre): A powerful sorcerer that unleashes a torrent of fire and plasma when it attacks.
* Gridlock Cardinal (Gridlock 64, 2017): A darker, green flying variant of the cyberdemon that cycles between different attacks. If flinched, it retaliates with a rocket.
	* Change: Reduced health from 8000 down to 4800.
* Hierophant (NOVA II: The Hirth, 2015): A flying afrit-like beast who can fire both a stream of baron projectiles and retaliates with a mancubus volley all at once.
	* Change: Reduced health from 8000 down to 5400.
* Hell Smith (Survive in Hell, 2012): This guy unleashes a powerful wave of 12 fireballs at once as his attack, and has a LOT of health. He spawns in the cyberdemon slot.
	* Change: Health reduced from 20000 to 8000, because he isn't the final boss of the game anymore.
* Motherdemon (Doom 64 for Doom 2, 2018): A terrifying flying boss monster that shoots mancubus fireballs and revenant missiles in large quantities that spawns rarely with cyberdemons.
	* Change: Removed the archvile attack, made it slower, reduced health from 9000 to 5300, and upped its pain chance, all changes remniscent of the original Doom 64.

* Hive Mother (Sunder, 2019): This 2000 HP insectoid demon can both fire mancubus fireballs very quickly AND retaliates with a set of three rockets when flinched.
	* Spawns with spider masterminds under special circumstances, otherwise it is limited to being summoned by the Icon of Sin and other final bosses.
* Avactor Brain (Avactor, 2018): A floating giant 2200 HP arachnorb-like brain monster that fires BFG shots.
* Flying Mastermind: While it only has 2000 HP, it's ability to fly gives it an edge that means which you should be careful while engaging it.
* Indomitable Mastermind (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy, 2018): A variant of the spider mastermind that uses both a super-chaingun AND a plasma rifle at the same time.
* Spectral Leviathan (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy, 2018): Less health and moves slower than the Leviathan, but he's partially invisible. Spawns with Spider Masterminds.
* Gate Master (Counterattack, 2017): A super arachnorb with 8000 HP and an Afrit-like attack.
* Remnant Master (Remnant, 2019): This thing looks like a flying mancubus, but it's far nastier. It can fire revenant missiles and uses an archvile attack if flinched.
* Angry Spiderdemon (Going Down, 2014): Her brain's red for some reason. Retaliates with fireballs when hurt, and has twice as much health as the ordinary Spider Mastermind.
	* Change: Health reduced from 12000 to 6000.
* Super Archvile (Valiant, 2015): Good luck. This thing attacks with a archvile combo-attack, and can resurrect monsters. It spawns uncommonly with the Spider Mastermind.
	* Change: Health reduced from 7500 to 3750, because it isn't the final boss of the game anymore.

* Gridlock Cardinal [Phase II]: Same as the Phase I, except if flinched, he'll spawn monsters icon-of-sin style. Replaces the Gridlock Cardinal if Spawn Targets are present.
	* Change: Reduced health from 6000 down to 4800.
* Leviathan [Summoner Variant]: He CAN be flinched, but doing so will result in him spawning monsters icon-of-sin style. Replaces either Leviathan if Spawn Targets are present.
	* Change: Reduced health from 10000 down to 4200.
* Super Archvile [Summoner Variant]: Summons a swarm of arachnorbs on flinch. Replaces the Super Archvile if Spawn Targets are present.

FINAL BOSSES (enabled by CVar and then selected in place of Icon of Sin):
* Hell Smith (Survive in Hell): More aggressive than his ordinary counterpart. With his full 20000 health, he is hard to take down, and spawns AFTER a large army of other monsters.
* Spider Mastermind (Going Down): A totally ordinary spider mastermind with nothing weird about it (ha, yeah right). Spawns with some zombies, imps, demons and revenants.
* Hierophant: With his full 8000 HP, alongside being aided by his many clones and other monsters being spawned in, this guy is tough to take down.
* Super Archvile [Final Boss Form] (Valiant): Spawns with a swarm of arachnorbs. Has 7500 health, and summons monsters when flinched, which get deadlier if flinched more than four times.
* Gridlock Cardinal [Final Boss Form] (Gridlock 64): This monstrosity has both phases and moves faster, and in phase two it even now has the ability to teleport. Good luck.
* Overlord (50 Monsters): A flying demon with a triple cacodemon attack and an ability to summon lost souls. This doesn't seem too bad at first...and then you enter phase 2.
* Motherdemon [Final Boss Form] (Doom 64 for Doom 2): With 9000 HP, an archvile attack, and an army of other monsters at its disposal, good luck; you'll need it here.
* Archangelus (Eviternity): Descending from the realm opposite Hell, this guy is insane. One might wish for good luck; but truth be told, it won't save you.
* Leviathan [Final Boss Form] (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy): With 10000 health, while also being summoned with many other monster-spawning statues, this guy's tough.
* Baphomet (DOOM -1): Spawning with his personal army before appearing on the battlefield himself, this guy's not trivial to take out.
* The Inquisitor (Struggle: Antaresian Legacy): This guy will unleash an absolute firestorm whenever you're in his line of sight, and spawns with a swarm of Afriests. Can't be spawned randomly.
* The Bubble Ship (Counterattack): Fires a stream of every vanilla monster attack at the player when he attacks. Spawns with a large number of skull turrets and cannot be spawned randomly.

CURRENTLY INCLUDED WEAPONS:

DOOM BETA:
* PLASMA RIFLE: Using alt-fire on the Plasma Rifle while playing vanilla Doomguy will spew alternating green and red projectiles.
* BFG 9000: If playing Vanilla Doomguy, the Beta BFG 9000, the 'Christmas gun', can be used by pressing alt-fire on the BFG 9000.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, this weapon becomes significantly more powerful and also much sillier.

STRAIN (Alpha Dog Alliance, 1997):
* DOUBLE FIST: Punches twice. Not much else to say here.
* SAWED-OFF: A variant of the shotgun that fires ever-so-slightly faster.
* NFG: Sharing the plasma slot, this powerful weapon does 140% more damage than the plasma rifle (5 base damage to 12), but uses NFG Batteries for ammo.
	* Change: Maximum Ammo doubled from 50/100 to 100/200, and pickups are upped from 3/15 to 6/30.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, this weapon uses only one ammo per two shots, at the expense of doing slightly less damage.
* PSYCHIC BLASTER: Uses three rockets a shot to fire partially invisible projectiles with insane direct hit damage.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, this weapon becomes significantly more explosive.

DEUS VULT II (Huy Pham, 2008):
* DUAL PISTOLS: Having much more stopping power than the singular pistol, this weapon can actually be useful sometimes.
* SAURON'S GAUNTLET: At sufficiently close range, you are now emperor palpatine. Almost any singular target too close to these will get shredded very quickly.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, this weapon becomes powered up, like in Heretic - meaning that, yes, it drains life.

VALIANT (skillsaw, 2015):
* SUPER PISTOL: Fires significantly faster than the normal pistol.
* SUPER CHAINGUN: 'You can't just make the chaingun fire twice as fast!' 'Ha ha, super chaingun go brrrrr'

MASKIM XUL (Obsidian, 2018):
* DUAL PISTOLS: They're back! Though they have a different firing sound than DV2's.
* HAND OF AFRIT: A magical equivalent to the rocket launcher that fires explosive comets with far higher radius damage.
	* Balanced Mode: If you're not playing Maskim Xul Doomguy, it takes 2 rockets per shot.
* JACK BOX: Fires a mysterious jack-in-the-box that lands in front of the shooter's feet. A few seconds later, it explodes for over 1000 damage.
* GRIMOIRE EXCIDIUM: Fires an even more powerful wave of BFG tracers upon firing, but deals a random amount of damage to the player each shot. Be careful!
	* Balanced Mode: Deals a fixed 40 damage per shot, but deals less damage.

EVITERNITY (Dragonfly et al, 2019):
* PISTOL: Fires faster and with perfect accuracy. This replaces the normal pistol if you're playing Doomguy because the normal pistol is garbage.

STRUGGLE: ANTARESIAN LEGACY (antares, 2018):
* HAMMER: This melee weapon is still fairly useless, but at least it hits for more damage than the normal fist. It still works with Berserk, however!
* DRILL MACHINE: Significantly faster than the chainsaw, this thing rips into demon flesh surprisingly effectively.
* PISTOL: Antaresian Legacy's pistol fires faster and in rounds of two bullets at once, making it significantly stronger.
* SHOTGUN: It looks fancy, but it's really just a slightly faster version of the normal shotgun.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: Loaded with blue shells, otherwise this weapon is identical to the normal super shotgun.
* DUAL PISTOLS: It turns out when you start with an already strong pistol, dual-wielding it makes the weapon pretty damn good.
* GRENADE LAUNCHER: It fires 75% slower than the normal rocket launcher, but it does FAR higher single-target damage per missile.
* ASSAULT RIFLE: Despite being what looks like a bullet weapon, it's very close to the plasma rifle in usage. Uses .223 caliber magazines for ammo.
* LEICHENFAUST: And you thought the BFG 9000 was crazy. This uses rocket ammo, and against non-splash immune enemies it puts the BFG 9000 to shame.

ANTARESIAN RELIQUARY (antares, 2020):
* FIST: The Antaresian Reliquary marine can punch much harder than the ordinary marine.
* CHAINSAW: slashes at a slightly increased speed compared to the vanilla chainsaw, but it's not as significant as other changes.
* MACHINEGUN: Rather than start with a pistol, the Antaresian Reliquary marine starts with a fairly useful machine gun.
	* Balanced Mode: No longer is the weapon perfectly accurate. It still fires absurdly fast for a pistol, however.
* SHOTGUN: Fires ever so slightly faster, compared to the ordinary doom shotgun.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: Autoloading shells means you can speedload this wonderful weapon even faster.
* ROCKET LAUNCHER: Overall slightly buffed compared to the normal rocket launcher.
* PLASMA RIFLE: The damage matches STRAIN's NFG, but it fires MUCH slower. Antaresian Cells are given in quantities of 16 (cell)/80 (cell pack).
	* Balanced Mode: If you're not playing Antaresian Doomguy, it uses 2 cells per shot.
* BFG 9000: Uses 30 Antaresian Cells instead of 40 ordinary energy cells. The projectile does slightly less damage than the ordinary BFG.

DOOM -1 (Community Project, 2020):
* GAUNTLET OF THE NECROMANCER: Not quite Sauron's Gauntlet from DV2; in fact, it's just a chainsaw re-skin. It looks neat, though.
* PISTOL: This thing fires faster than the ordinary pistol. It's still pretty weak.
* SHOTGUN: Despite the difference in looks, it's identical to the normal shotgun.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: And similarily, despite the new look, it's still the same old reliable SSG.
* UZI: The replacement for the chaingun, this weapon fires faster, matching pace with Struggle's Dual Pistols.
* ROCKET LAUNCHER: Same as the normal version, with a new look suited for Doom -1.
* DARK SCEPTRE: A variant of the plasma rifle that fires slower but with projectiles that do slightly more damage and occasionally home in on enemies.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, this weapon fires faster.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, it also gains a VERY powerful altfire under specific circumstances. It feels a little...heretical?
* UNMAKYR: Despite the new look, it's functionally identical to the BFG 9000. Alt-fire, referencing older builds of DOOM -1's Unmakyr, fires the old BFG.
	* Turning balanced mode off changes the Altfire entirely. Though, really, what the $%^& is this?

ROWDY RUDY 2 (Doomkid, 2020):
* FISTS: Rowdy Rudy's close quarters combat training enables him to punch faster and with better damage.
* DOUBLE-BLADED CHAINSAW: This is obviously only meant for killing, and does so with twice the efficiency of the normal chainsaw.
* RIFLE: It's perfectly accurate, and fires faster than the normal pistol, giving it a strong presence as Rudy's starting weapon.
	* Change: Rowdy Rudy 2 doubles bullet ammo pickups (20/100 instead of 10/50), but for balance reasons it's kept at 10/50 here.
	* Balanced Mode: Works identically to Rowdy Rudy 1, meaning it fires in bursts in two, but fires much slower.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, it magically only uses one bullet per two shots to emulate doubled pickup sizes.
* AUTOMATIC SHOTGUN: This weapon shreds demons far ahead of the relative competition, owing to a faster automatic reloading system.
* CHAINGUN: Rowdy Rudy's chaingun is made from a darker metal, and fires faster, matching pace with DOOM -1's Uzi.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, it magically only uses one bullet per two shots.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: While Rowdy Rudy can reload the weapon faster than usual, ultimately this is just a return to the old reliable SSG.
	* Balanced Mode: Rowdy Rudy cannot load the weapon faster than usual.
* ROCKET LAUNCHER: Putting the 'Rowdy' in Rowdy Rudy, this weapon fires faster than the ordinary Rocket Launcher.
	* Balanced Mode: Fires at the same rate as the normal rocket launcher, but with the new sprites.
* BFG 9000: It's yellow now, and it's...basically identical to the standard BFG 9000. Sometimes, you can't beat the original.
	* If balanced mode is turned off, it gets some additional tracers, in accordance with rowdy2.txt's description.

RAY MOHAWK 2 (Doomkid, 2021):
* KNIFE: Faster and dealing massive damage relative to the ordinary fist, Ray Mohawk came to town prepared for a fight.
* GAUNTLETS?: No one's quite sure how these got here, but these things fire twice as fast as the chainsaw.
	* Balanced Mode: No, actually only twice as fast instead of four times as fast.
* PISTOL: Ray Mohawk's pistol isn't really a pistol at all, but is instead a more compact shotgun, firing seven pellets per shot.
	* Balanced mode: Only fires 3 pellets instead of 7. Sorry, but this is a starting weapon, and a literal shotgun is too much power to have.
* SHOTGUN: Fires 20 pellets for 2 shells, meaning that in effect this is really the Super Shotgun.
	* Balanced Mode: Fires an ordinary shotgun blast. Not getting the SSG in the normal Shotgun slot, kiddo.
* AUTOMATIC SHOTGUN: Rapidly empties shells into enemies to destroy them.
	* Balanced Mode: Again, 7 pellets, 1 shell, because a Super Shotgun with a pistol's fire rate is too much, but the ASG is fairly unique in its own right.
* BLASTER: Borrowed from the Spider Mastermind except with the playerside buff, this thing sprays lead at an unfathomable rate in the direction you point in.
	* Balanced Mode: It's only 3 bullets per shot instead of 7, alongside a massive accuracy decrease. You're still the mastermind now, just more literally.
* FLAMETHROWER: Ray doesn't use a conventional rocket launcher, and in its place is a flamethrower that's closer to the plasma rifle with a distinct ammo type.
	* Change: Fuel pickups are 10/50 instead of 20/100 like they are in Ray Mohawk 2.
	* Change: Moved from Slot 6 to Slot 5 for ammo consistency reasons.
	* Balanced Mode: Base damage reduced from 15 to 7. Still stronger than the plasma rifle, but not by nearly as much.
* CELL CANNON: Ray's explosive weapon. Awkwardly placed in the plasma slot but cell ammo comes in bigger packages, meaning he can get more value out of them.
	* Change: Moved from Slot 5 to Slot 6 for ammo consistency reasons.
	* Balanced Mode: Uses 5 cells (up from 1) because effectively infinite rockets is a bit much, and it does less damage.
* BFG 9002: An upgrade to the BFG 9000, it does less direct hit damage, but far more tracer damage.
	* Balanced Mode: Uses 50 cells per shot (up from 25), meaning that you've got to commit to using this thing.
