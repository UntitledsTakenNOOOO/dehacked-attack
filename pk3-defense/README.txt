Counterpart to Dehacked Attack, consisting of custom weapons rather than monsters.

You can use the options in the menu to control which WADs' weapons sets are enabled or disabled in the randomizer,
or whether or not to spawn weapons in a purely class-based manner. sv_weaponstay only respects the class-based weaponset.

CURRENTLY INCLUDED WEAPONS:

DOOM BETA:
* PLASMA RIFLE: Using alt-fire on the Plasma Rifle while playing vanilla Doomguy will spew alternating green and red projectiles.
* BFG 9000: If playing Vanilla Doomguy, the Beta BFG 9000, the 'Christmas gun', can be used by pressing alt-fire on the BFG 9000.

STRAIN (Alpha Dog Alliance, 1997):
* DOUBLE FIST: Punches twice. Not much else to say here.
* SAWED-OFF: A variant of the shotgun that fires ever-so-slightly faster.
* NFG: Sharing the plasma slot, this powerful weapon does 140% more damage than the plasma rifle (5 base damage to 12), but uses NFG Batteries for ammo.
	* Change: Maximum Ammo doubled from 50/100 to 100/200, and pickups are upped from 3/15 to 6/30.
* PSYCHIC BLASTER: Uses three rockets a shot to fire partially invisible projectiles with insane direct hit damage.

DEUS VULT II (Huy Pham, 2008):
* DUAL PISTOLS: Having much more stopping power than the singular pistol, this weapon can actually be useful sometimes.
* SAURON'S GAUNTLET: At sufficiently close range, you are now emperor palpatine. Almost any singular target too close to these will get shredded very quickly.

VALIANT (skillsaw, 2015):
* SUPER PISTOL: Fires significantly faster than the normal pistol.
* SUPER CHAINGUN: 'You can't just make the chaingun fire twice as fast!' 'Ha ha, super chaingun go brrrrr'

MASKIM XUL (Obsidian, 2018):
* DUAL PISTOLS: They're back! Though they have a different firing sound than DV2's.
* HAND OF AFRIT: A magical equivalent to the rocket launcher that fires explosive comets with far higher radius damage.
    * Balanced Mode: If you're not playing Maskim Xul Doomguy, it takes 2 rockets per shot.
* JACK BOX: Fires a mysterious jack-in-the-box that lands in front of the shooter's feet. A few seconds later, it explodes for over 1000 damage.
* GRIMOIRE EXCIDIUM: Fires an even more powerful wave of BFG tracers upon firing, but deals a random amount of damage to the player each shot. Be careful!
    * Balanced Mode: Deals a fixed 40 damage per shot, but deals less damage.

EVITERNITY (Dragonfly et al, 2019):
* PISTOL: Fires faster and with perfect accuracy. This replaces the normal pistol if you're playing Doomguy because the normal pistol is garbage.

STRUGGLE: ANTARESIAN LEGACY (antares, 2018):
* HAMMER: This melee weapon is still fairly useless, but at least it hits for more damage than the normal fist. It still works with Berserk, however!
* DRILL MACHINE: Significantly faster than the chainsaw, this thing rips into demon flesh surprisingly effectively.
* PISTOL: Antaresian Legacy's pistol fires faster and in rounds of two bullets at once, making it significantly stronger.
* SHOTGUN: It looks fancy, but it's really just a slightly faster version of the normal shotgun.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: Loaded with blue shells, otherwise this weapon is identical to the normal super shotgun.
* DUAL PISTOLS: It turns out when you start with an already strong pistol, dual-wielding it makes the weapon pretty damn good.
* GRENADE LAUNCHER: It fires 75% slower than the normal rocket launcher, but it does FAR higher single-target damage per missile.
* ASSAULT RIFLE: Despite being what looks like a bullet weapon, it's very close to the plasma rifle in usage. Uses .223 caliber magazines for ammo.
* LEICHENFAUST: And you thought the BFG 9000 was crazy. This uses rocket ammo, and against non-splash immune enemies it puts the BFG 9000 to shame.

ANTARESIAN RELIQUARY (antares, 2020):
* FIST: The Antaresian Reliquary marine can punch much harder than the ordinary marine.
* CHAINSAW: slashes at a slightly increased speed compared to the vanilla chainsaw, but it's not as significant as other changes.
* MACHINEGUN: Rather than start with a pistol, the Antaresian Reliquary marine starts with a fairly useful machine gun.
* SHOTGUN: Fires ever so slightly faster, compared to the ordinary doom shotgun.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: Autoloading shells means you can speedload this wonderful weapon even faster.
* ROCKET LAUNCHER: Overall slightly buffed compared to the normal rocket launcher.
* PLASMA RIFLE: The damage matches STRAIN's NFG, but it fires MUCH slower. Antaresian Cells are given in quantities of 16 (cell)/80 (cell pack).
    * Balanced Mode: If you're not playing Antaresian Doomguy, it uses 2 cells per shot.
* BFG 9000: Uses 30 Antaresian Cells instead of 40 ordinary energy cells. The projectile does slightly less damage than the ordinary BFG.

DOOM -1 (Community Project, 2020):
* GAUNTLET OF THE NECROMANCER: Not quite Sauron's Gauntlet from DV2; in fact, it's just a chainsaw re-skin. It looks neat, though.
* PISTOL: This thing fires faster than the ordinary pistol. It's still pretty weak.
* SHOTGUN: Despite the difference in looks, it's identical to the normal shotgun.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: And similarily, despite the new look, it's still the same old reliable SSG.
* UZI: The replacement for the chaingun, this weapon fires faster, matching pace with Struggle's Dual Pistols.
* ROCKET LAUNCHER: Same as the normal version, with a new look suited for Doom -1.
* HELLSTAFF: A variant of the plasma rifle that fires slower but with projectiles that do slightly more damage and occasionally home in on enemies.
* UNMAKYR: Despite the new look, it's functionally identical to the BFG 9000. It's still a very powerful weapon, however.

ROWDY RUDY 2 (Doomkid, 2020):
* FISTS: Rowdy Rudy's close quarters combat training enables him to punch faster and with better damage.
* DOUBLE-BLADED CHAINSAW: This is obviously only meant for killing, and does so with twice the efficiency of the normal chainsaw.
* RIFLE: It's perfectly accurate, and fires faster than the normal pistol, giving it a strong presence as Rudy's starting weapon.
* AUTOMATIC SHOTGUN: This weapon shreds demons far ahead of the relative competition, owing to a faster automatic reloading system.
* SUPER SHOTGUN: While Rowdy Rudy can reload the weapon faster than usual, ultimately this is just a return to the old reliable SSG.
    * Balanced Mode: Rowdy Rudy cannot load the weapon that much faster than usual.
* ROCKET LAUNCHER: Putting the 'Rowdy' in Rowdy Rudy, this weapon fires faster than the ordinary Rocket Launcher.
    * Balanced Mode: Fires at the same rate as the normal rocket launcher, but with the new sprites.
* PLASMA RIFLE: 'It's green now! That's my attack!'
* BFG 9000: More of the damage is in the tracers, making this potentially deadlier, but easier to waste the potential of.
    * Balanced Mode: Does less damage, though not by as much as one might expect.

RAY MOHAWK 1/2 (Doomkid, 2021):
* KNIFE: Faster and dealing massive damage relative to the ordinary fist, Ray Mohawk came to town prepared for a fight.
* GAUNTLETS?: No one's quite sure how these got here, but these things fire twice as fast as the chainsaw, or half as fast as Sauron's Gauntlets from DV2.
* PISTOL: Ray Mohawk's pistol isn't really a pistol at all, but is instead a more compact shotgun, firing seven pellets per shot.
	* Balanced mode: it fires only three pellets and it's less accurate. Sorry, but this is a starting weapon, and a literal shotgun is too much power to have.
* SHOTGUN: Fires 20 pellets for 2 shells, meaning that in effect this is really the Super Shotgun.
	* Balanced Mode: 9 pellets, 1 shell. Not in the ordinary Shotgun slot, kiddo.
* AUTOMATIC SHOTGUN: Rapidly empties shells into enemies to destroy them.
	* Balanced Mode: 7 pellets, 1 shell, because a Super Shotgun with a pistol's fire rate is way too much.
* CHAINGUN: Borrowed from the Spider Mastermind except with the playerside buff, this thing sprays lead at an unfathomable rate in the direction you point in.
	* Balanced Mode: Back to only 3 pellets and it's much less accurate. You're still the mastermind now!
* FLAMETHROWER: Ray doesn't use a conventional rocket launcher, and in its place is a flamethrower that's closer to the plasma rifle with a distinct ammo type.
    * Balanced Mode: Base damage reduced from 15 to 8. Still stronger than the plasma rifle, but not by nearly as much.
* CELL CANNON: Ray's explosive weapon. Awkwardly placed in the plasma slot but cell ammo comes in bigger packages, meaning he can get more value out of them.
	* Balanced Mode: Uses 5 cells (up from 1) because effectively infinite rockets is a bit much.
* BFG 9002: An upgrade to the BFG 9000, it's killing power is off the charts.
    * Balanced Mode: Uses 50 cells per shot (up from 25), meaning that you've got to commit to using this thing.
